# DockIntellihide.app

Adds "Intellihide" function to the Dock.

This is similar to Ubuntu Unity's Intellihide: your Mac OS X Dock will be always shown, unless a window of the active application overlaps it.

## Usage

Simply fork this repository or [download the latest version](https://github.com/downloads/gjherbiet/DockIntellihide.app/DockIntellihide.zip).

If you like it, add it to your **Login Items** in **Users & Groups** pane of **System Preferences**.

### Note:

This requires **Enable access for assistive devices** to be activated in the
**Universal Access** pane of **System Preferences**. If not active, you will be prompted to activate it at first launch. Relaunch `DockIntellihide.app` afterwards.

### Lion compatibility:

This is fully compatible with Lion: with full screen apps, the Dock will hide automatically and return to its previous state when switching to a regular app.
